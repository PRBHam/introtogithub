# Creating webpages and websites on GitHub

You can use GitHub to create webpages or whole websites. There are a couple of main ways to do this:

* Use the automatic webpage generator to take your existing Markdown files and turn them into webpages
* Create HTML files yourself

[You can find more information here](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/)

## Choosing a repo to publish from

There are 3 main places you can publish your website from:

* The `master` branch of your project (which is created when you set up your repo)
* A folder called `/docs` in that repo
* Or a *branch* you have called `gh-pages`

[This guide](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/) explains how to set up GitHub pages to publish your site from different branches or folders in your repo.
