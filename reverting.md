# Reverting to previous versions

One of the main features of GitHub is its ability to keep a record of all the changes you have made to a repo.

Every time you make a change it is called a '**commit**'. 

On the GitHub website, you need to 'commit changes' every time you edit a file and want to save those changes, but on the GitHub Desktop client you can edit multiple files locally, and those then 'commit to Master'. 

In both cases your commit is accompanied by a short **summary**, and you can also add a longer **description**.
